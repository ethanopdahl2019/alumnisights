    story: "As a first-generation college student from a small town in Ohio, I had no idea where to even begin with my college applications. My high school counselor was helpful but overwhelmed with hundreds of other students. Connecting with Sarah, a current Harvard student through AlumniSights, completely changed my trajectory. She helped me understand what Harvard was really looking for, how to highlight my unique experiences, and gave me honest feedback on my essays. I truly don't think I would have been accepted without her guidance.",

    story: "I was fortunate enough to be accepted to several top engineering programs, but this created a new problem - how to choose between them? Rankings only tell you so much, and campus visits weren't enough to understand what daily life would actually be like. Through AlumniSights, I connected with engineering students at each of my top choices. These conversations revealed aspects of the programs I never would have discovered otherwise - from research opportunities to department culture to job placement. I ultimately chose Stanford because my mentor helped me see how it aligned with both my academic interests and personal preferences.",
    quote: "The insider perspective from current students helped me make a confident decision I haven't regretted for a moment."

    story: "Applying to US universities as an international student was overwhelming. I had so many questions about standardized testing, financial aid for international students, and how to make my application stand out. Through AlumniSights, I connected with two Berkeley alumni who had also been international students. They walked me through every step of the process, helped me understand the unwritten cultural aspects of US applications, and gave me honest advice about financing my education. Their guidance was invaluable in helping me present my unique perspective and secure admission to my dream school.",
    quote: "Having mentors who understood both my culture and the American university system was exactly what I needed."
